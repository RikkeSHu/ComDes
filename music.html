            <h2 class="fade">Newcomers In The Norwegian Music Industry</h2>

            <p class="intro-paragraph fade" data-label="01 · A fast-moving scene">

                The Norwegian music industry is moving faster than ever, 
                driven by global trends and a rising generation of young, 
                independent artists who are reshaping what Norwegian music can be. 
                With streaming platforms, social media, and affordable home-studio equipment, 
                more musicians than ever are able to create and release music on their own terms. 
                Norway’s music scene is often associated with well-known genres like pop, electronic, 
                and hip hop, but beneath the charts lies a diverse network of underground creators who blend styles, 
                challenge norms, and build audiences far beyond their local communities.
            </p>

            <p class="intro-paragraph fade" data-label="02 · Silent majors">
                As part of this article, we contacted Norway’s three major record labels through either their website, or email — 
                Warner Music, Sony Music, and Universal Music — to hear their thoughts on today’s music landscape and 
                the rise of independent artists. Despite multiple inquiries, none of them responded to our request for comment.
            </p>

            <p class="intro-paragraph fade" data-label="03 · Hard to break through">
                At the same time, breaking through in Norway can be both accessible and difficult. 
                The country has a strong culture of supporting creative work through grants, festivals, 
                and organizations, yet competition is high, and visibility often depends on consistency, 
                online reach, and self-promotion. For many emerging artists, 
                the biggest challenges aren’t just musical — they involve marketing, social media, 
                financial barriers, and navigating the gap between passion and practicality.
            </p>

            <p class="intro-paragraph fade" data-label="04 · Two artists, one generation">
                In this environment, two young artists, Radin and Xhevrije, 
                each with their own sound and story, are carving out their place. 
                Their experiences reflect both the possibilities and pressures facing Norway’s new generation of musicians. 
                Through their perspectives, we gain an honest look at creativity, ambition, 
                and the realities of building a music career in today’s Norwegian industry.

                                <h3>Finding Freedom in Sound: An Interview with Xhevrije</h3>
                                <p><strong>By Rikke Strand Husby, Student at Høgskolen i Østfold (HiØ)</strong></p>

                                <p>
                                    The small bedroom where 21-year-old Xhevrije creates her music doesn’t look like the birthplace of ambition. 
                                    A narrow bed pressed against the wall, a simple desk with scattered notebooks, and soft lighting that gives the room a warm, almost protective feel. 
                                    Though she lives in Halden, pieces of her Albanian heritage rest quietly around the room — a few photos, a bracelet, small reminders of where she comes from.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This is her entire studio. A phone, a pair of earphones, and her voice.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    There’s something almost intimate about watching her talk about music here, in a space that feels more like a sanctuary than a workspace. 
                                    She sits comfortably, legs tucked under her, speaking with the openness of someone who creates for the sake of emotion rather than attention.
                                </p>

                                <blockquote>
                                    “What I love most is the freedom,” she says, smiling softly. “Just messing around, having fun, and creating something people can connect to. 
                                    When I make something I’m proud of, that’s the best feeling.”
                                </blockquote>

                                <p>
                                    For her, music is instinct rather than structure. She doesn’t follow a formula, a checklist, or a step-by-step method. She follows the moment.
                                </p>

                                <blockquote>
                                    “It’s all about passion,” she explains. “I just love music. The process, the feeling, the creation. That alone keeps me inspired.”
                                </blockquote>

                                <p>
                                    She laughs when asked how many songs she’s made so far.
                                </p>

                                <blockquote>
                                    “I genuinely don’t know,” she admits. “Hundreds? Probably more.”
                                </blockquote>

                                <p>
                                    But almost none of them are public. Right now, everything lives on her phone — half-finished verses, freestyles, melodies she recorded late at night before falling asleep. 
                                    She keeps them private, not out of fear, but out of intention.
                                </p>

                                <blockquote>
                                    “I don’t share my songs yet,” she says. “I want to save them in case I publish them one day. I want to feel ready.”

                                    The challenges she faces have nothing to do with creativity. Those come easily. It’s everything around it that feels heavy.

                                <blockquote>
                                    “The biggest and most disappointing thing is the prices and lease agreements for licensing beats,” she says. 
                                    “The rights don’t really favor you, even when you buy ‘full rights.’ It’s like you’re always at a disadvantage.”

                                <p>
                                    Despite that, her goals remain grounded. She’s not dreaming of fame or viral moments — she’s dreaming of connection.
                                </p>

                                <blockquote>
                                    “I want people to connect with my music and find their own meaning in it,” she says. 
                                    “I want my songs to feel personal — like they belong to the listener too.”

                                    She describes her music process with the same ease she creates it. There’s no ritual. No “start with the hook, then verse” kind of discipline. 
                                    She simply presses record and lets the moment guide her.

                                    “I freestyle most of my songs,” she says. “I just record until I find the vibe. Then I go back, polish the lyrics a bit, and record again. After that, it’s mixing — all on my phone.”

                                    She doesn’t follow the Norwegian music scene closely, but she sees how social media has reshaped everything — even for artists who haven’t shared their work yet.

                                    I’ve seen people I know blow up just because they were consistent and hit the right moment.”

                            <h3>Turbulent Thoughts in Music</h3>
                            <p><strong>By Malene Steffensen-Andersen, Student at Høgskolen i Østfold (HiØ)</strong></p>

                            <br>

                            <p><strong>Radin was sitting leaning back in his chair having a relaxing posture.</strong></p>

                            <p>In the corner of his small student apartment, his desk surrounded by purple LED lights and stacks of cables, he leans back in a worn black gaming chair. His music setup — an audio interface, a simple mic, and a pair of well-used but carefully maintained headphones — sits neatly arranged on a compact desk. The atmosphere is quiet, the kind of calm that makes it easy to forget how much creativity flows in this space. He speaks slowly, relaxed, almost thoughtful, as if every answer is something he’s still discovering.</p>

                            <p>He shrugs lightly, smiling as the question makes him chuckle a little, while he leans forward from his gaming chair.</p>

                            <blockquote>
                                “I don’t know,” he says. “I’ve just always been interested in music and stuff. Back in 2016–2017 I was super into underground rap and hip hop. One day I just randomly thought, ‘Oh! It would be cool to make music.’ I wanted to reach a point where I could think of an idea and actually create it. That was the inspiration, just a random thought that stuck.”

                            <p>He looks around his small apartment for a moment, like he’s imagining something a little bigger, a little quieter.</p>

                            <blockquote>
                                “I just want to live a comfortable life making music,” he says simply. “I don’t need to be super rich. I just want to make enough to get a house someday. And mostly, I want to be able to make music when I want to, while having a steady income. That’s the main goal. Everything after that is just bonuses.

                                My small goals right now are to drop my album in January, and everything around that. After that, to get the same or more success as <em>Turbulente Tanker</em> albumet mitt. More recognition — not only from people who listen, but from organizations.”

                                It depends on what you mean with the «industry». I feel like the word «industry» is really rooted in how america uses the word industry. 
                                I have no real experience with the industry. I am a member of tono, and have been featured on NRK P3. But they are not really part of the industry. Really… tono is a music ordning that gives stipend money to support new artist, but they support musicians through the goverment money. The same with NRK P4. They also get money through the goverment to push new artist on the radio, and tv. They are not part of the industry, they are just a part of the cultural things the goverment gives money to support artists. 
                                <br><br>
                                 I would say that all the cultural ordningene and p3 Urørt to support new artist is really good, and is a part of it that i have really felt. But the industry pushing new artist is nothing I have experience with. I would personally say no, i have never got any help from them. For example Warner bros or universell. I would never been part of a label. 
                                 <br><br>
                                 I was in contact with a guy tha was signed under a label universel owns. Dutty dior is part of the same level. I have seen it second hand. And before he was signed he was dropping Music all the time, but after he was signed he was dropping music oficially was very rare. Every time he dropped something it was almost always a single, or a collab with a bigger artist. It always was liked they were thinking «how could we invest in him so it goes well». It seems like once you are under a label, you lose control.

                                 Spotify is really known for not playing artist a shit. It is the most knows streaming plattform, and they have a really good algorithm. So you reach a lot of people that would like your music.

                                I don’t use instagram a lot. It is a part where people could see a little more of me. The reach aspect here is much worse than Spotify. I still use it as a library of me and my music.
                                <br><br>
                                I only use tiktok when I am promoting new songs. That is because they have the best algorithm. It is effective, but you have to set yourself in on what works, and sometimes it is random. I feel like it is like buying som LODD to up the chances of reaching new people. Until now nothing has gone viral there.
                                <br><br>
                                Snapchat is a lot better than instagram at reaching people. Every time I post it is showed to all my friends, and pushed to random people. On instagram it is really random who sees your post because they have other algorithms on their pages, but on Snapchat they still have the classic that all your friends on Snapchat sees it. On Snapchat 400 people could be my friends, and 100 new people.

F                               or me is purely international. For me when I started rapping, I was only listening to underground rap from America. It was newly I started listening to Norwegian rap. And they seem like they are inspired by older Norwegian hip hop. So they have Norwegian sound.

F                               It is a lot easier here. Tono gives out money to all the member every 3 money. They give money based on if you have had concerts, streams, or radio. It will be like a bonus intekt. I just got 1400kr because of streams and a concert I had last year. When you see I get that amount of money, and not a big artist, you can imagine what bigger artists who is members get. It is a really good ordning.

                                The biggest barrier is the language. If you do it English, you will most likely become a part of the sea of other music.

                                If you do it in Norwegian, you become a part of a little more niche thing for people who is interested in unique music. You can reach a more loyal and invested fans. You most likely would need to use a little more money on promoting. I was suprised by how many was interested in music in a language they don’t speak

                                I feel like now with tiktok and stuff performing live is not AS important as it once was. But it is important for you as an artist. That is where you would make the most money. But it is also where you would create a bond with your listeners. And since you are not a big artist, you will not be the main performer, which is a good thing. It is a good thing because it expands who will have acces to your music and hear your music.

                                I started making lofi beats because that was the easiest to start with and to learn to make music. It became a vibe. When I learned more about production, I started expirement more. then I started listening to Kendrick Lamar, Tyler the creator. They were big inspirations in the start. Right now my biggest influence right now is JPEG mafia in production. It’s really expirimental.

                 I wouldn’t say I’m at some crazy point right now, but I’ve kept going even if the work hasn’t always been consistent.
                I’ve been doing this for about eight years, and it’s definitely been a lot of work.
                I also reinvest everything I earn from music back into my music. That really helps.

                            <h3>Freedom in Creation: Leaving a Lasting Mark</h3>

                            <blockquote>
                                 Both Xhevrije and Radin share a similar outlook on what creativity truly means. For them, music is not built around charts, fame, or follower counts — it is built around feeling. It’s a space where thoughts settle, emotions move freely, and small moments gain meaning. Even though their approaches are different, their reasons for creating come from the same place.
                                Radin sits in his small apartment, shaping beats and lyrics with a producer’s discipline, constantly refining and reinvesting in his craft. His process is one of layering, adjusting, and patiently building the sound he imagines.
                                Xhevrije, on the other hand, creates in the quiet of her bedroom, freestyling into her phone until the right emotion rises to the surface. Her creativity is instinctive — unfiltered, private, and deeply personal. While her music remains unheard for now, it is growing, taking shape, waiting for the moment she decides to let it step into the world.
                                Despite their different spaces, tools, and experiences, both artists find meaning in the same idea: freedom.
                                Freedom to explore.
                                Freedom to experiment.
                                Freedom to create without pressure.
                                And within that freedom lies their shared goal — not to become famous, but to evolve. To find listeners who understand what they’re trying to say. To make music that feels real, honest, and lasting.
                                What connects them isn’t just their age or their location, but the belief that music should outlive the moment it’s made. Both hope that one day, someone will play their songs and remember exactly where they were, what they felt, and why it mattered. In their own ways, both Radin and Xhevrije aim to leave behind something more than sound: a trace of themselves, captured in a form that others can feel too.
