                <p class="intro-paragraph fade" data-label="01 · A fast-moving scene">
                    The Norwegian music industry is moving faster than ever, driven by global trends and a rising generation of young, independent artists who are reshaping what Norwegian music can be. With streaming platforms, social media, and affordable home-studio equipment, more musicians than ever are able to create and release music on their own terms. Norway’s music scene is often associated with well-known genres like pop, electronic, and hip hop, but beneath the charts lies a diverse network of underground creators who blend styles, challenge norms, and build audiences far beyond their local communities.
                </p>

                <p class="intro-paragraph fade" data-label="02 · Silent majors">
                    As part of this article, we contacted Norway’s three major record labels through their websites or by email, namely Warner Music, Sony Music, and Universal Music, to hear their thoughts on today’s music landscape and the rise of independent artists. We had no luck.
                </p>

                <p class="intro-paragraph fade" data-label="03 · Hard to break through">
                    At the same time, breaking through in Norway can be both accessible and difficult. 
                    The country has a strong culture of supporting creative work through grants, festivals, 
                    and organizations, yet competition is high, and visibility often depends on consistency, 
                    online reach, and self-promotion. For many emerging artists, 
                    the biggest challenges aren’t just musical — they involve marketing, social media, 
                    financial barriers, and navigating the gap between passion and practicality.
                </p>

                <p class="intro-paragraph fade" data-label="04 · Two artists, one generation">
                    In this environment, two young artists, Radin and Xhevrije, each with their own sound and story, are carving out their place. Their experiences reflect both the possibilities and the pressures facing Norway’s new generation of musicians. Through their perspectives, we gain a clear look at creativity, ambition, and the realities of building a music career in today’s Norwegian industry.

                        <p><strong>By Rikke Strand Husby, Student at Høgskolen i Østfold (HiØ)</strong></p>

                        <p>
                            The small bedroom where 21-year-old Xhevrije creates her music doesn’t look like the birthplace of ambition. 
                            A narrow bed pressed against the wall, a simple desk with scattered notebooks, and soft lighting that gives the room a warm, almost protective feel. 
                            Though she lives in Halden, pieces of her Albanian heritage rest quietly around the room — a few photos, a bracelet, small reminders of where she comes from.

                        </div>

                        <p>
                            This is her entire studio. A phone, a pair of earphones, and her voice.
                        </p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

                        <p>
                            There’s something almost intimate about watching her talk about music here, in a space that feels more like a sanctuary than a workspace. 
                            She sits comfortably, legs tucked under her, speaking with the openness of someone who creates for the sake of emotion rather than attention.
                        </p>

                        <blockquote>
                            “What I love most is the freedom,” she says, smiling softly. “Just messing around, having fun, and creating something people can connect to. 
                            When I make something I’m proud of, that’s the best feeling.”
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>
                            For her, music is instinct rather than structure. She doesn’t follow a formula, a checklist, or a step-by-step method. She follows the moment.
                        </p>

                        <blockquote>
                            “It’s all about passion,” she explains. “I just love music. The process, the feeling, the creation. That alone keeps me inspired.”
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>
                            She laughs when asked how many songs she’s made so far.
                        </p>

                        <blockquote>
                            “I genuinely don’t know,” she admits. “Hundreds? Probably more.”
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>
                            But almost none of them are public. Right now, everything lives on her phone — half-finished verses, freestyles, melodies she recorded late at night before falling asleep. 
                            She keeps them private, not out of fear, but out of intention.
                        </p>

                        <blockquote>
                            “I don’t share my songs yet,” she says. “I want to save them in case I publish them one day. I want to feel ready.”
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>
                            The challenges she faces have nothing to do with creativity. Those come easily. It’s everything around it that feels heavy.
                        </p>

                        <blockquote>
                            “The biggest and most disappointing thing is the prices and lease agreements for licensing beats,” she says. 
                            “The rights don’t really favor you, even when you buy ‘full rights.’ It’s like you’re always at a disadvantage.”
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>
                            Despite that, her goals remain grounded. She’s not dreaming of fame or viral moments — she’s dreaming of connection.
                        </p>

                        <blockquote>
                            “I want people to connect with my music and find their own meaning in it,” she says. 
                            “I want my songs to feel personal — like they belong to the listener too.”

                        <h3>Freestyling Her Way to Emotion</h3>

                        <p>
                            She describes her music process with the same ease she creates it. There’s no ritual. No “start with the hook, then verse” kind of discipline. 
                            She simply presses record and lets the moment guide her.
                        </p>

                        <blockquote>
                            “I freestyle most of my songs,” she says. “I just record until I find the vibe. Then I go back, polish the lyrics a bit, and record again. After that, it’s mixing — all on my phone.”
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>
                            She pauses, thinking.
                        </p>

                        <blockquote>

                        <p>
                            She doesn’t follow the Norwegian music scene closely, but she sees how social media has reshaped everything — even for artists who haven’t shared their work yet.
                        </p>

                        <blockquote>
                            “It’s so much easier now to get ears on you,” she says. “You don’t have to hand out CDs or beg people to listen. TikTok has changed people’s lives. 
                            I’ve seen people I know blow up just because they were consistent and hit the right moment.”

                        <p>
                            Genres, she believes, matter less now than ever.
                        </p>

                        <blockquote>
                            “Pop travels easier because it’s universal,” she says. “But alternative or niche genres can reach people too. The internet broke those limits.”

                            Live shows and festivals, in her view, are meaningful — but not mandatory.
                        </p>

                        <blockquote>
                            “They’re not necessary to get your music out there,” she says. “But they help. You get exposure, experience, and you get to connect with people in real life.”

                        <p>
                            Her influences are artists who have carved their own lanes, refusing to imitate anyone but themselves.
                        </p>

                        <blockquote>
                            “Bryson Tiller inspires me a lot,” she says. “His song ‘Don’t’ wasn’t even something he planned to release until his friends pushed him. And after that, everything changed for him.”
                        </blockquote>

                        <blockquote>
                            “It depends on the artist,” she says. “Some do it for passion, others for money. There’s a big difference between being influenced by someone and impersonating them. Authenticity comes from intent.”

                        <p><strong>By Malene Steffensen-Andersen, Student at Høgskolen i Østfold (HiØ)</strong></p>

                            Radin sat leaning back in his chair, relaxed, in the corner of his small student apartment. His desk was surrounded by purple LED lights and stacks of cables, and he leaned back in a worn black gaming chair. His music setup, which included an audio interface, a microphone, and a pair of well used but well cared for headphones, was neatly arranged on his desk. The atmosphere was quiet, the kind of calm that makes it easy to forget how much creativity moves through this space. He spoke slowly, relaxed, almost thoughtful, as if every answer was something he was still discovering.

                        <h3>What inspired you to make music?</h3>

                        <p>He shrugs lightly, smiling as the question makes him chuckle a little while he leans forward from his gaming chair.</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            “I don’t know,” he says. “I have just always been interested in music and similar things. Back in the period from 2016 to 2017 I was really into underground rap and hip hop. One day I just thought, ‘Oh, it would be cool to make music.’ I wanted to reach a point where I could think of an idea and actually create it. That was the inspiration, just a random thought that stayed with me.”  
                            <br><br>
                            “Honestly, everything inspired me when I started.”

                            “Most of the struggles aren’t even about making the music. It is the time, and everything around the music. The videos, TikTok, promotion and so on. Making music feels natural. Everything around it feels… unnatural.”

                        <p>He looks around his small apartment for a moment, like he’s imagining something a little bigger, a little quieter.</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            “I just want to live a comfortable life making music,” he says simply. “I do not need to be very rich. I just want to make enough to get a house someday. And mostly, I want to be able to make music when I want to while having a steady income. That is the main goal. Everything after that is just a bonus.  
                            <br><br>
                            My smaller goals right now are to release my album in January in a good way, and everything that comes with that. After that, I want to reach the same level of success or more than I had with my previous album <em>Turbulente Tanker</em>. I want the new album to get more recognition, not only from listeners, but also from organizations.”

                            “It depends on what you mean by the word industry. I feel like the word industry is strongly connected to how America uses it. I have no real experience with the industry. I am a member of <a href="https://www.tono.no/" target="_blank">Tono</a> and I have been featured on <a href="https://urort.p3.no/artist/radin" target="_blank">NRK P3</a>, but they are not really part of the industry. Tono is a music organization that gives grant money to support new artists, but they support musicians through government funding. It is the same with NRK P3. They also get money through the government to push new artists on radio and television. They are not part of the industry, they are part of the cultural sector that the government supports.”  
                            <br><br>
                            “I would say that all the cultural organizations and P3 Urørt give very good support to new artists, and that is something I have really felt. But the industry pushing new artists is not something I have experienced. I would personally say no, I have never received any help from them. For example, Warner or Universal. And I would never want to be part of a label anyway.”

                        <h3>How do digital platforms affect your chances of success?</h3>

                        <p>
                            “I define success in two parts. The economic aspect, and the part where you reach a lot of people, for example through streams, concerts, and fans who support you.”  
                            <br><br>
                            “Spotify is known for not paying artists well. It is the most well known streaming platform, and it has a very good algorithm. Because of that, you can reach a lot of people who would like your music.”  
                            <br><br>
                            “I do not use Instagram a lot. It is a place where people can see a little more of me. The reach there is much worse than on Spotify, but I still use it as a library of me and my music.”  
                            <br><br>
                            “I only use TikTok when I am promoting new songs. That is because they have the best algorithm. It is effective, but you have to understand what works, and sometimes it is random. I feel like it is the same as buying tickets in a lottery to increase the chances of reaching new people. So far, nothing I have posted there has gone viral.”  
                            <br><br>
                            “Snapchat is a lot better than Instagram when it comes to reaching people. Every time I post something, it is shown to all my friends and pushed to random people. On Instagram it is very random who sees your posts because they have different algorithms on their pages. But on Snapchat, they still use the classic system where all your friends see what you post. On Snapchat four hundred people could be my friends, and one hundred could be new people.”  
                            <br><br>
                            If I would have rated them I would have said: Spotify, Snapchat, TikTok, instagram.

                        <h3>Is there a Norwegian sound, or do artist adapt to international trends?</h3>

                        <p>
                            For me it is purely international. When I started rapping, I was only listening to underground rap from America. It was only recently that I started listening to Norwegian rap. And they seem to be inspired by older Norwegian hip hop. So they have a Norwegian sound.

                        <h3>How difficult is it to get resources in Norway, compared to bigger music markets?</h3>

                        <p>
                            It is a lot easier here. Tono gives out money to all members every three months. They give money based on whether you have had concerts, streams, or radio plays. It works like a bonus income. I just got fourteen hundred kroner because of streams and a concert I had last year. When you see that I get that amount of money and I am not a big artist, you can imagine what bigger artists who are members receive. It is a very good system.
                        <br><br>
                            I would say Norway is the best place to make music.

                        “The biggest barrier is the language. If you do it in English, you will most likely become part of the sea of other music. 
                        <br><br>
                        If you do it in Norwegian, you become part of something more niche for people who are interested in unique music. You can reach more loyal and invested fans. You would most likely need to spend a little more money on promotion. I was surprised by how many people were interested in music in a language they do not speak.”

                        “I feel like now, with TikTok and similar platforms, performing live is not as important as it once was. But it is still important for you as an artist. That is where you make most of your money. It is also where you build a connection with your listeners. And since you are not a big artist, you will not be the main performer, which is actually a good thing. It is a good thing because it expands who will have access to your music and who will hear your music.”

                        I started making lofi beats because that was the easiest way to start and to learn how to make music. It became a vibe. When I learned more about production, I started to experiment more. Then I started listening to Kendrick Lamar and Tyler the Creator. They were big inspirations in the beginning. Right now my biggest influence in production is JPEG Mafia. It is very experimental.”

                            I wouldn’t say I’m at some crazy point right now, but I’ve kept going even if the work hasn’t always been consistent.
                            I’ve been doing this for about eight years, and it’s definitely been a lot of work.
                            I also reinvest everything I earn from music back into my music. That really helps.

                        I would hope I have had reached more succes with a lot more projects. So I have my music now, would give a good insights of how I was, and a good impression. I would want the songs to still be bangers.

                        I would want people to go back and listen to the songs as the journey I have been on. I don’t want the old songs to overshadow something new I have made. It happens to a lot of artists, but I would like people to appreciate the old songs. I would not like a big contrast for the old and new music.

            <div class="intro-inner">
                <h2 class="fade">Where Do We Go From Here?</h2>

                <p class="intro-paragraph fade" data-label="Similar outlooks, different processes">
                    Both Xhevrije and Radin share a similar outlook on what creativity truly means. For them, music is not built around charts, fame, or follower counts — it is built around feeling. It’s a space where thoughts settle, emotions move freely, and small moments gain meaning. Even though their approaches are different, their reasons for creating come from the same place.
                </p>

                <p class="intro-paragraph fade" data-label="">
                    Radin sits in his small apartment, shaping beats and lyrics with a producer’s discipline, constantly refining and reinvesting in his craft. His process is one of layering, adjusting, and patiently building the sound he imagines.
                </p>

                <p class="intro-paragraph fade" data-label="">
                    Xhevrije, on the other hand, creates in the quiet of her bedroom, freestyling into her phone until the right emotion rises to the surface. Her creativity is instinctive — unfiltered, private, and deeply personal. While her music remains unheard for now, it is growing, taking shape, waiting for the moment she decides to let it step into the world.
                </p>

                <p class="intro-paragraph fade" data-label="">
                    And within that freedom lies their shared goal — not to become famous, but to evolve. To find listeners who understand what they’re trying to say. To make music that feels real, honest, and lasting.
                </p>

                <p class="intro-paragraph fade" data-label="">
                    What connects them isn’t just their age or their location, but the belief that music should outlive the moment it’s made. Both hope that one day, someone will play their songs and remember exactly where they were, what they felt, and why it mattered. In their own ways, both Radin and Xhevrije aim to leave behind something more than sound: a trace of themselves, captured in a form that others can feel too.
