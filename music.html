                <h2>Finding Freedom in Sound: An Interview with Xhevrije</h2>
                By Rikke Strand Husby, Journalism Student at Høgskolen i Østfold (HiØ)
                <p> For 21-year-old Xhevrije, an Albanian artist living in Halden, Norway, music is more than a creative outlet — it’s a space for freedom, emotion, and connection. Her process is fluid and instinctive, grounded in passion rather than rigid structure.
                “The ability to be free in how I craft my art — that’s what I love most,” she says. “I enjoy messing around, having fun, and making something people can connect to. It’s fulfilling to create something I can genuinely be proud of.”
                That sense of joy fuels everything she does. For Xhevrije, music isn’t about fame or perfection — it’s about feeling.
                “It’s all about passion,” she explains. “I just love music — the process, the feeling, the creation. That alone keeps me inspired.”
                Still, like many independent artists, she’s had her share of frustrations — especially when it comes to the financial side of music production.
                “The biggest and most disappointing thing would have to be the prices and lease agreements for licensing beats,” she says. “The rights don’t really favor you as the artist, even when you buy ‘full rights.’”
                Despite the challenges, Xhevrije’s goal remains simple and heartfelt.</p>
                <p> “I want people to connect with my music and find their own meaning in it,” she says. “I want my songs to feel personal — like they belong to the listener too.”
                When asked about her process, she smiles. Unlike artists who start with a hook or a concept, she prefers to let inspiration guide her.
                “I like to freestyle most of my songs,” she says. “I don’t have a fixed order — I just freestyle until I find the vibe and flow, then polish the lyrics and record. After that, it’s all about mixing and making sure the track feels right.”
                Xhevrije admits she doesn’t follow the Norwegian music scene closely, but she’s fascinated by how social media has transformed the industry.
                “It’s way easier now to get ears on you compared to before,” she explains. “You don’t have to hand out CDs — social media, especially TikTok, has changed people’s lives. I’ve seen people I personally know blow up just from consistency and the right moment online.”</p>
               <p>  While pop music tends to dominate the charts, she believes any genre can find success if it connects with listeners.
                “Pop tends to travel easier because it’s universal, but alternative or niche genres can reach people too,” she says. “The internet broke those limits down.”
                When it comes to live shows and festivals, Xhevrije sees them as valuable experiences — but not essential.
                “They’re not necessary to get your music out there, but they definitely help,” she says. “Festivals and live shows give you exposure and experience — and they help you connect with people in real life.”
                Her inspiration comes from artists who’ve followed their own paths, like Bryson Tiller.
                “His story really inspires me,” she says. “His hit ‘Don’t’ wasn’t even something he planned to release until his friends pushed him to. Then he quit his job at Papa John’s, and the rest is history.”
                For Xhevrije, authenticity is everything.</p>
               <p>“It depends on the artist,” she reflects. “Some people do it purely for passion, others for money. There’s a big difference between being influenced by someone and impersonating them. Authenticity comes from intent.”
                At the heart of it all, music remains deeply personal.
                “For me, it’s personal first,” she says. “I have hundreds of unreleased songs that are just for me. But if people tell me they like a certain sound, I might explore it more while still making what feels right to me.”
                When asked what she hopes listeners will take away from her music, her answer is simple — and nostalgic.
                “I want people to look back and feel something,” she says softly. “To remember where they were when they first heard it.”</p>
