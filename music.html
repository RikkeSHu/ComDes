            <h2 class="fade">Newcomers In The Norwegian Music Industry</h2>

            <p class="intro-paragraph fade" data-label="01 · A fast-moving scene">

                The Norwegian music industry is moving faster than ever, 
                driven by global trends and a rising generation of young, 
                independent artists who are reshaping what Norwegian music can be. 
                With streaming platforms, social media, and affordable home-studio equipment, 
                more musicians than ever are able to create and release music on their own terms. 
                Norway’s music scene is often associated with well-known genres like pop, electronic, 
                and hip hop, but beneath the charts lies a diverse network of underground creators who blend styles, 
                challenge norms, and build audiences far beyond their local communities.
            </p>

            <p class="intro-paragraph fade" data-label="02 · Silent majors">
                As part of this article, we contacted Norway’s three major record labels through either their website, or email — 
                Warner Music, Sony Music, and Universal Music — to hear their thoughts on today’s music landscape and 
                the rise of independent artists. Despite multiple inquiries, none of them responded to our request for comment.
            </p>

            <p class="intro-paragraph fade" data-label="03 · Hard to break through">
                At the same time, breaking through in Norway can be both accessible and difficult. 
                The country has a strong culture of supporting creative work through grants, festivals, 
                and organizations, yet competition is high, and visibility often depends on consistency, 
                online reach, and self-promotion. For many emerging artists, 
                the biggest challenges aren’t just musical — they involve marketing, social media, 
                financial barriers, and navigating the gap between passion and practicality.
            </p>

            <p class="intro-paragraph fade" data-label="04 · Two artists, one generation">
                In this environment, two young artists, Radin and Xhevrije, 
                each with their own sound and story, are carving out their place. 
                Their experiences reflect both the possibilities and pressures facing Norway’s new generation of musicians. 
                Through their perspectives, we gain an honest look at creativity, ambition, 
                and the realities of building a music career in today’s Norwegian industry.

                    <h3>Finding Freedom in Sound: An Interview with Xhevrije</h3>
                    <p><strong>By Rikke Strand Husby, Student at Høgskolen i Østfold (HiØ)</strong></p>
                    <p>For 21-year-old Xhevrije, an Albanian artist living in Halden, Norway, music is more than a creative outlet — it’s a space for freedom, emotion, and connection. Her process is fluid and instinctive, grounded in passion rather than rigid structure.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                    “The ability to be free in how I craft my art — that’s what I love most,” she says. “I enjoy messing around, having fun, and making something people can connect to. It’s fulfilling to create something I can genuinely be proud of.”
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>That sense of joy fuels everything she does. For Xhevrije, music isn’t about fame or perfection — it’s about feeling.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                    “It’s all about passion,” she explains. “I just love music — the process, the feeling, the creation. That alone keeps me inspired.”
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Still, like many independent artists, she’s had her share of frustrations — especially when it comes to the financial side of music production.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                    “The biggest and most disappointing thing would have to be the prices and lease agreements for licensing beats,” she says. “The rights don’t really favor you as the artist, even when you buy ‘full rights.’”
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Despite the challenges, Xhevrije’s goal remains simple and heartfelt.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                    “I want people to connect with my music and find their own meaning in it,” she says. “I want my songs to feel personal — like they belong to the listener too.”
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>When asked about her process, she smiles. Unlike artists who start with a hook or a concept, she prefers to let inspiration guide her.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                    “I like to freestyle most of my songs,” she says. “I don’t have a fixed order — I just freestyle until I find the vibe and flow, then polish the lyrics and record. After that, it’s all about mixing and making sure the track feels right.”
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Xhevrije admits she doesn’t follow the Norwegian music scene closely, but she’s fascinated by how social media has transformed the industry.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                    “It’s way easier now to get ears on you compared to before,” she explains. “You don’t have to hand out CDs — social media, especially TikTok, has changed people’s lives. I’ve seen people I personally know blow up just from consistency and the right moment online.”
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>While pop music tends to dominate the charts, she believes any genre can find success if it connects with listeners.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                    “Pop tends to travel easier because it’s universal, but alternative or niche genres can reach people too,” she says. “The internet broke those limits down.”
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>When it comes to live shows and festivals, Xhevrije sees them as valuable experiences — but not essential.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                    “They’re not necessary to get your music out there, but they definitely help,” she says. “Festivals and live shows give you exposure and experience — and they help you connect with people in real life.”
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Her inspiration comes from artists who’ve followed their own paths, like Bryson Tiller.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                    “His story really inspires me,” she says. “His hit ‘Don’t’ wasn’t even something he planned to release until his friends pushed him to. Then he quit his job at Papa John’s, and the rest is history.”
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>For Xhevrije, authenticity is everything.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                    “It depends on the artist,” she reflects. “Some people do it purely for passion, others for money. There’s a big difference between being influenced by someone and impersonating them. Authenticity comes from intent.”
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>At the heart of it all, music remains deeply personal.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                    “For me, it’s personal first,” she says. “I have hundreds of unreleased songs that are just for me. But if people tell me they like a certain sound, I might explore it more while still making what feels right to me.”
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>When asked what she hopes listeners will take away from her music, her answer is simple — and nostalgic.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                    “I want people to look back and feel something,” she says softly. “To remember where they were when they first heard it.”
                    </blockquote>

                            <p><strong>Radin was sitting leaning back in his chair having a relaxing posture.</strong></p>

                            <p>In the corner of his small student apartment, his desk surrounded by purple LED lights and stacks of cables, he leans back in a worn black gaming chair. His music setup — an audio interface, a simple mic, and a pair of well-used but carefully maintained headphones — sits neatly arranged on a compact desk. The atmosphere is quiet, the kind of calm that makes it easy to forget how much creativity flows in this space. He speaks slowly, relaxed, almost thoughtful, as if every answer is something he’s still discovering.</p>

                            <p>He shrugs lightly, smiling as the question makes him chuckle a little, while he leans forward from his gaming chair.</p>

                            <blockquote>
                                “I don’t know,” he says. “I’ve just always been interested in music and stuff. Back in 2016–2017 I was super into underground rap and hip hop. One day I just randomly thought, ‘Oh! It would be cool to make music.’ I wanted to reach a point where I could think of an idea and actually create it. That was the inspiration, just a random thought that stuck.”

                                “I just want to live a comfortable life making music,” he says simply. “I don’t need to be super rich. I just want to make enough to get a house someday. And mostly, I want to be able to make music when I want to, while having a steady income. That’s the main goal. Everything after that is just bonuses.

                                My small goals right now are to drop my album in January, and everything around that. After that, to get the same or more success as <em>Turbulente Tanker</em> albumet mitt. More recognition — not only from people who listen, but from organizations.”

                                It depends on what you mean with the «industry». I feel like the word «industry» is really rooted in how america uses the word industry. 
                                I have no real experience with the industry. I am a member of tono, and have been featured on NRK P3. But they are not really part of the industry. Really… tono is a music ordning that gives stipend money to support new artist, but they support musicians through the goverment money. The same with NRK P4. They also get money through the goverment to push new artist on the radio, and tv. They are not part of the industry, they are just a part of the cultural things the goverment gives money to support artists. 
                                <br><br>
                                 I would say that all the cultural ordningene and p3 Urørt to support new artist is really good, and is a part of it that i have really felt. But the industry pushing new artist is nothing I have experience with. I would personally say no, i have never got any help from them. For example Warner bros or universell. I would never been part of a label. 
                                 <br><br>
                                 I was in contact with a guy tha was signed under a label universel owns. Dutty dior is part of the same level. I have seen it second hand. And before he was signed he was dropping Music all the time, but after he was signed he was dropping music oficially was very rare. Every time he dropped something it was almost always a single, or a collab with a bigger artist. It always was liked they were thinking «how could we invest in him so it goes well». It seems like once you are under a label, you lose control.

                                "I define succes in two parts. The economic aspect, and reach a lot of people for example streams, concerts, fans supporting you."
                                <br><br>
                                 Spotify is really known for not playing artist a shit. It is the most knows streaming plattform, and they have a really good algorithm. So you reach a lot of people that would like your music.
                                <br><br>
                                I don’t use instagram a lot. It is a part where people could see a little more of me. The reach aspect here is much worse than Spotify. I still use it as a library of me and my music.
                                <br><br>
                                I only use tiktok when I am promoting new songs. That is because they have the best algorithm. It is effective, but you have to set yourself in on what works, and sometimes it is random. I feel like it is like buying som LODD to up the chances of reaching new people. Until now nothing has gone viral there.
                                <br><br>
                                Snapchat is a lot better than instagram at reaching people. Every time I post it is showed to all my friends, and pushed to random people. On instagram it is really random who sees your post because they have other algorithms on their pages, but on Snapchat they still have the classic that all your friends on Snapchat sees it. On Snapchat 400 people could be my friends, and 100 new people.

F                               It is a lot easier here. Tono gives out money to all the member every 3 money. They give money based on if you have had concerts, streams, or radio. It will be like a bonus intekt. I just got 1400kr because of streams and a concert I had last year. When you see I get that amount of money, and not a big artist, you can imagine what bigger artists who is members get. It is a really good ordning.

                                If you do it in Norwegian, you become a part of a little more niche thing for people who is interested in unique music. You can reach a more loyal and invested fans.

That is where you would make the most money. But it is also where you would create a bond with your listeners. And since you are not a big artist, you will not be the main performer, which is a good thing. It is a good thing because it expands who will have acces to your music and hear your music.

Right now my biggest influence right now is JPEG mafia in production. It’s really expirimental.

                 I wouldn’t say I’m at some crazy point right now, but I’ve kept going even if the work hasn’t always been consistent.
                I’ve been doing this for about eight years, and it’s definitely been a lot of work.
                I also reinvest everything I earn from music back into my music. That really helps.

                                Both Xhevrije and Radin share a similar outlook on creativity — that music isn’t just about fame or numbers, but about expression and connection. For them, it’s a way to make sense of thoughts, emotions, and moments in time. Whether it’s Radin producing tracks from his small apartment in Halden or Xhevrije freestyling until the right feeling appears, both artists find meaning in the freedom to create. Their goals are simple but powerful: to grow, to be heard, and to leave behind something people can feel — something real.
