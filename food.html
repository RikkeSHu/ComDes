                <p><strong>By Rikke Strand Husby, Student at Høgskolen i Østfold (HiØ) & Irune Sarasola Areizaga, Student at University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU)</strong></p>

                       The smell of instant noodles drifts down the hallway from a student dorm on a Tuesday evening. 
                       In one kitchen, two exchange students share a pot of stew they learned from YouTube. 
                       Down the hall, someone cooks rice with eggs– the classic “struggle meal.” For students everywhere, 
                       food is more than just fuel: it’s survival, identity, and often a test of creativity.

                        Our survey and interviews show a clear pattern in how students manage food on a budget. 
                        Most students — 83.3% — usually cook for themselves, and 75% say they cook at home 5–7 days a week. 
                        Their go-to recipes often come straight from social media, with 66.7% saying TikTok is their main source of budget meal ideas.

                    The interviews reveal the same habits. Diana says she 
                    <strong>“usually makes something with pasta or rice because it’s fast,”</strong>while Sara often relies on sandwiches, 
                    omelets or instant noodles with a bit of vegetables added. Another student sticks to pasta, noodles or 
                    “rice with egg — the classic broke student combo.” Favorite struggle meals were almost identical across interviews: 
                    pasta with anything, rice with egg and soy sauce, or quick toast dishes.

                    Price plays a major role in how students shop. According to the survey, 
                    83.8% always check prices when buying food, and 58.3% usually shop at discount supermarkets. 
                    The interviewees described similar strategies: making shopping lists based on planned meals, 
                    checking what’s already at home, or visiting different stores to find the cheapest items. 
                    One student said they learned over time <strong>“which shop has the cheapest version of each ingredient,”</strong> 
                    while another looks for discount stickers before closing time.

                    Sharing food is another way students save money.
                    In the survey, 50% said they sometimes share meals with roommates or friends. 
                    Cooking together, swapping ingredients or splitting big bags of rice and pasta are common tricks.

                    Even with careful planning, the biggest food expense remains eating out. 
                    Half of all respondents said that buying food on campus or in cafés is what raises their monthly spending the most. 
                    This matches the interviews too: even though all three students try to stay around 30–40 euros per week, 
                    coffee breaks or social meals easily push their budgets above 50 euros.

                            Most students rely on discount supermarkets, but many also visit larger chains or 
                            smaller convenience stores. Online grocery delivery is almost never used.

                    Across both interviews and survey results, 
                    the picture is clear: students rely on simple ingredients, careful budgeting, 
                    and a lot of creativity. Whether it’s a pot of pasta, a bowl of rice, 
                    or a TikTok recipe tested in a small dorm kitchen, students find ways to eat well without letting their finances collapse.
