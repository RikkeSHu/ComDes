                    The smell of instant noodles drifts down the hallway from a student dorm on a Tuesday evening. In one kitchen, two exchange students share a pot of stew they learned from YouTube. Down the hall, someone cooks rice with eggs– the classic “struggle meal.” For students everywhere, food is more than just fuel: it’s survival, identity, and often a test of creativity.

                    Living on a budget means choices—between cooking at home, grabbing a cafeteria tray, or giving in to the convenience of pre-made meals. For many, the weekly trip to the discount store is a careful balancing act between cost, taste, and health. Instead of flipping through cookbooks, most students now scroll through TikTok for inspiration, watching short videos that turn cheap ingredients into quick, creative meals. Others rely on recipes shared by roommates or family–small tricks passed along like treasured secrets.

                    Eating cheap isn’t just about saving money. Sometimes, it’s about making the most of limited time, cramped kitchens, and whatever ingredients fit into a backpack. And whether in Norway, Spain, or anywhere else, students share the same challenge: how to eat well without going broke. Simple ingredients such as pasta, rice, eggs or frozen vegetables can be transformed into countless meals, depending on imagination and taste. Cooking becomes both a necessity and an experiment: mixing sauces, combining leftovers and trying a recipe seen online that promises flavor on a budget.

                    Part of the art of eating cheaply is planning, but not in an overwhelming way. Students learn to balance effort and convenience, sometimes cooking in batches to have food ready for the week, other times improvising with whatever is at hand. Students move between supermarkets looking for the best deals, making weekly shopping a careful game of comparing prices. Cooking together, sharing ingredients, or swapping recipes your roommate swears by–it’s a way to save money and actually enjoy the process.

                    Ultimately, eating cheap as a student is about creativity, independence, and small victories. It’s about discovering that a modest pot of rice, a bowl of pasta, or a simple soup can be both satisfying and nourishing. It’s about making the most of what you have, finding efficient ways to cook, and managing a budget without giving up on taste. In the end, it’s about handling student life on a budget and finding ways to eat well anyway.
