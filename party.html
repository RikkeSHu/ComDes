                <h2 class="article-text">Between Tapas and Pre-drinks: A Spaniard´s Take on Party Culture in Norway</h2>
                <p><strong>By Elsa Carrillo Espada, Student at Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain</strong></p>
                <p class="article-text">For many international students, coming to Norway becomes one of the most surprising cultural
                    contrasts in many ambits. One of them is the difference between their parties and the party here.
                    For this 22-year-old Spaniard living in Halden, Norway, it's no exception. Between quiet pre-drinks
                    and late-night bars, he's learned that how people celebrate says a lot about their picture.</p>
                <blockquote class="article-text">“In Norway we do the pre-drinks in someone's apartment before going out and are in a bar or
                    outside the place we're going.”</blockquote>

                <p class="article-text">A small survey carried out among Norwegian and Spanish students supports these impressions.
                    When asked where parties usually take place, <strong>81.8% of Norwegian respondents said in someone's home</strong>,
                    while <strong>100% of Spanish respondents answered in a disco or club</strong>. This matches Borja’s experience and
                    highlights the very different social settings where each culture celebrates.</p>

                <p class="article-text">In social terms, according to Borja, things couldn’t be more different.</p>
                <blockquote class="article-text">“In Spain, yes, people are very open and you can easily make friends.”</blockquote>
                <blockquote class="article-text">“In Norway it is a bit different; at the beginning people can be distant or shy, but when
                    they start drinking it is easier.”</blockquote>

                <p class="article-text">Music choices also reflect this cultural gap. In the survey, <strong>72.7% of Norwegian participants
                    said pop is the most common party music</strong>, whereas <strong>100% of Spanish respondents chose reggaeton</strong>.
                    For Borja, this wasn’t surprising: Spain’s party atmosphere is heavily shaped by rhythm and dance.</p>

                <p class="article-text">The atmosphere itself changes completely from one country to another.</p>
                <blockquote class="article-text">“Spanish parties are louder and warmer, full of contact interaction, and Norwegian parties
                    are structured, I mean, first is the pre-drink, then we go to a bar, the bar is calmer.”</blockquote>

                <p class="article-text">Even the way people dance and interact reveals cultural differences.</p>
                <blockquote class="article-text">“Definitely, in Spain the parties are during the grand part of the night, even if you don't
                    dance, you enjoy it. In Norwegian ones the Norwegian people dance more individually, and sometimes
                    it takes a few drinks before people feel more comfortable.”</blockquote>

                <p class="article-text">On the other hand, alcohol plays a very different role in both cultures.</p>
                <blockquote class="article-text">“Norway alcohol is central because it is expensive and people drink a lot at home before
                    going out, and in Spain alcohol is present but is not the only focus. It is better to have a
                    conversation or to be together.”</blockquote>
                <blockquote class="article-text">“In Norway how late and intensely people drink at home before even leaving. In Spain I don't
                    know, maybe we drink until sunrise.” he laughed.</blockquote>

                <p class="article-text">Talking about how he felt about being in Norwegian parties, he said that at first he felt
                    out of place, because the vibe is more reserved.</p>
                <blockquote class="article-text">“But it is fun.”</blockquote>

                <p class="article-text">And finally, when imagining the perfect party, he doesn't hesitate.</p>
                <blockquote class="article-text">“For me the perfect party would be with the music of Spain, of course, and maybe a mix of
                    the intimacy and the conscience of Norwegian pre-drink doing games and wild mood before going out.”</blockquote>

                <p class="article-text">In the end, whether in a crowded Spanish night or a quiet Norwegian apartment, it’s all about
                    connection: the laughter, the shared moments, and the memories that last long after the music fades.</p>
