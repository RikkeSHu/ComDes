                <h2>Between Tapas and Pre-drinks: A Spaniard´s Take on Party Culture in Norway</h2>
                <p>For many international students, coming to Norway becomes one of the most surprising cultural contrasts in many ambits. One of them is the difference between their parties and the party here. For this 22-year-old Spaniard living in Halden, Norway, it's no exception. Between quiet pre-drinks and late-night bars, he's learned that how people celebrate says a lot about their picture.</p>
                <blockquote>“In Norway we do the pre-drinks in someone's apartment before going out and are in a bar or outside the place we're going.”
                </blockquote>
                <p>In social terms, according to Borja, things couldn´t be more different.</p>
                <blockquote>“In Spain, yes, people are very open and you can easily make friends.” He says.</blockquote> 
                <blockquote>“In Norway it is a bit different; at the beginning people can be distant or shy, but when they start drinking it is easier.”</blockquote>
                <p>The atmosphere itself changes completely from one country to another.</p> 
                <blockquote>“Spanish parties are louder and warmer, full of contact interaction, and Norwegian parties are structured, I mean, first is the pre-drink, then we go to a bar, the bar is calmer.”</blockquote>
                <p>Even the way people dance and interact reveals cultural differences.</p>
                <blockquote>“Definitely, in Spain the parties are during the grand part of the night, even if you don't dance, you enjoy it. In Norwegian ones the Norwegian people dance more individually, and sometimes it takes a few drinks before people feel more comfortable.”</blockquote>
                <p>On the other hand, alcohol plays a very different role in both cultures.</p>
                <blockquote>“Norway alcohol is central because it is expensive and people drink a lot at home before going out, and in Spain alcohol is present but is not the only focus. It is better to have a conversation or to be together.”</blockquote>
                <blockquote>“In Norway how late and intensely people drink at home before even leaving. In Spain I don't know, maybe we drink until sunrise.” he laughed. </blockquote>
                <p>Talking about how he felt about being in Norwegian parties, he said that at first in Norway he felt out of place, because the vibe is more reserved.</p>
                <blockquote>“But it is fun.”- he claimed</blockquote>
                <p>And finally, when imagining the perfect party, he doesn't hesitate.</p>
                <blockquote>“For me the perfect party would be with the music of Spain, of course, and maybe a mix of the intimacy and the conscience of Norwegian pre-drink doing games and wild mood before going out.”</blockquote>
                <p>At the end, whether in a crowded Spanish night or a quiet Norwegian apartment, it´s all about connection: the laughter, the shared moments, and the memories that last long after the music faces.</p>
